• The chat application is built using Node.js and Socket.IO. It enables real-time communication between users, allowing them to join chat rooms, send and receive messages instantly.

• Socket.IO is a JavaScript library for real-time web applications. It uses WebSocket protocol when available and falls back to other protocols (such as HTTP long polling) in browsers that do not support WebSocket. Socket.IO enables bidirectional communication between the server and clients.

• The Node.js server is set up using the Express framework. The socket.io library is used to handle WebSocket connections. New user connections trigger the 'new-user-joined' event, and disconnections trigger the 'disconnect' event on the server.

• Clients establish a connection with the server using const socket = io('http://localhost:8000');. User input is captured through a form, and the emit method sends messages to the server. The on method listens for incoming messages from the server.

• Multiple users are handled by organizing them into rooms. When a user joins, the server adds them to a room, and when a user leaves, they are removed from the room. Broadcasting ensures that messages are sent to all users in the same room, allowing a seamless multi-user chat experience.
